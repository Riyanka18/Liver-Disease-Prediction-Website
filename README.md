# Liver-Disease-Prediction-Website
#### Aim of this project is to design a website for Liver Disease prediction from the inputs provided by the user. We have designed a UI that is a web page connected to the python file and the inputs from the UI reach python file through flask.Next Logistic regression is used to make prediction with the help of training dataset. After the prediction is made the outcome is sent through flask and a final result page is displayed with the outcome and accuracy of prediction.
